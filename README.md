# pandas-challenge

In this challenge, I am the Cheif Data Scientist for my city's school district, and I have been tasked with heping the mayor and the school board make strategic decisions on school budgets. School and standardized test data is analyzed through Pandas DataFrames and Jupyter Notebook. 

## The District Summary data includes:
  - Total number of unique schools 
  - Total students
  - Total budget
  - Average math score
  - Average reading score
  - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
  - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
  - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

## The School Summary data includes:
  - School name
  - School type
  - Total students
  - Total school budget
  - Per student budget
  - Average math score
  - Average reading score
  - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
  - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
  - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

*The data was then formulated to show the top 5 of the highest-performing schools and bottom 5 of the lowest-performing schools.*

*Next, the average math and reading scores are calculated for each grade level, from 9th to 12th grade, at each school in the district.*

*Lastly, a table is created to break down the school performance based on the avergae spending range per student. With the information that was calculated, a DataFrame called spending_summary was created.*

## The Spending Summary data includes:
  - Average math score
  - Average reading score
  - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
  - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
  - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

*DataFrames are created for Scores by School Size and Scores by School Type
